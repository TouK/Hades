 What is it?

  Hades is a java project that provides a HA (high availability) data source,
  which is also called Hades. Hades wraps two other data sources - the main
  one and the failover one - and exposes one of them at a time and can
  automatically switch between the two when certain conditions are met. These
  conditions are highly configurable. By default, when the main data source
  is overloaded, the failover data source is used. The load of a data base is
  determined on the basis of the average execution time of some configurable
  sql statement that is examined periodically.

  Each Hades exposes through JMX its state and also operations for
  manual switching between the two contained data sources in case automatic
  switching must be suppressed for some reason.
